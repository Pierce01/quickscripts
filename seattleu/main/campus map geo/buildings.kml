      <p class="buildingDescription">Originally built in 1966 and renovated in 2010, the Lemieux Library & McGoldrick Learning Commons combines new construction and renovation to offer a state-of-the-art facility of approximately 125,000 square feet. The library offers a number of services including research librarians with specialized focuses, the Math Lab for drop-in help with lower division mathematics courses, Learning Assistance Programs for tutoring and developing learning methods, and the Writing Center for assistance with writing assignments. Students can take advantage of individual and group study rooms, computer labs, reading rooms, and the Media Production Center which offers tools, training, and support for creating high quality creative content. The Byte, located on the second floor, is a good place to take a study break and grab a snack or drink. The Lemieux Library gets quieter as you move up the floors, with the sixth and top floor offering a completely silent reading space and housing Seattle University's special collections.</p>

        <p class="buildingDescription">Located at the edge of campus on Madison, near 12th Avenue, Vi Hilbert Hall opened in fall 2018. Named after Vi Hilbert, this new student housing community pays homage to the woman who devoted much of her life to keeping the Northwest native tribe of Lushootseed’s culture, language and stories alive. Also home to the division of Enrollment Services (which includes Registrar, Student Financial Services, Undergraduate Admissions, and Graduate Admissions), prospective students and their families touring Seattle University can expect an informational presentation at this building.
