key: bool = true/false ; sectionID = section's ID


For each section before its added to the delete request needs to be checked if it has children or is a mirror type.
If mirror type is something other then "none", we won't add it to the delete request. If it has children, an additinal request will be made
to add those content types to the delete request. Seeing as there's so much content going to be deleted on the intial request, there needs to be a queue
system made for these requests as making one large one would probably crash the entire site...

During the polling, we need to ignore folders with the name "Error Items" as those are mirrored content entries. However, I believe if the entry is
not a source item, then it can be deleted. 


Getting site-wide section listings for open sections. Super dumb that t4 only pulls information for open sections but whatever.

Getting the content entries specified within a specific section:

The endpoint that does all the magic.
